# CD137_Tcells_ODE

Two master R markdown scripts can be used to reproduce figures. These are:

/rscripts/data_analysis.Rmd
(reproduces all figures that do not rely on ODE model) 

/rscripts/parameter_estimation/v3/ODE_MODEL_v3.rmd
(reproduces all figures that do rely on ODE model)

additional notes about useage are contained within each script (can also be viewed in the corresponding .html files)
